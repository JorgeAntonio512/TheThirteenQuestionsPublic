The Thirteen Questions

If you need help with The Thirteen Questions, you’re in the right place.

What this app does

The Thirteen Questions is a deliberately limited, one-time decision clarity tool. It guides you through thirteen questions and then ends. The app does not give advice, store answers, or provide ongoing features.

Because of this intentional design, many issues resolve simply by starting a new session.

Common questions

Are my answers saved?
No. Your answers exist only during an active session and are discarded when the app ends.

Can I review past answers or decisions?
No. The app is intentionally one-time and does not retain history.

Does the app give advice or recommendations?
No. The app does not tell you what to do or evaluate your decisions.

Can I reset or start over?
Yes. Closing and reopening the app starts a new session.
